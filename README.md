DRAMMS
======

*** A Generic Medical Image Registration Toolbox ***




DRAMMS is a software package designed for 2D-to-2D and 3D-to-3D medical image registration tasks.



  Some typical applications of DRAMMS include,

  -- Cross-subject registration of the same organ (can be brain, breast, cardiac, etc);

  -- Mono- and Multi-modality registration (MRI, CT, histology);

  -- Longitudinal registration (pediatric brain growth, cancer development, mouse brain development, etc);

  -- Registration under missing correspondences (e.g., vascular lesions, tumors, histological cuts).



DRAMMS is implemented as a Unix command-line tool. It is fully automatic and easy to use — users input two images, and DRAMMS will output the registered image and the associated deformation. No need for pre-segmentation of structures, or prior knowledge, or human initialization/interventions.
