DRAMMS Image Registration Toolbox 
=======================================================


**Introduction**: DRAMMS is a software package designed for 2D-to-2D and 3D-to-3D deformable medical image registration tasks.



**Download**:     github folder dramms-1.4.1 (https://github.com/ouyangming/DRAMMS/tree/master/dramms-1.4.1-source)

or DRAMMS website (http://www.rad.upenn.edu/sbia/software/dramms/download.html)

**Installation**: http://www.rad.upenn.edu/sbia/software/dramms/installation.html


**Applications**: Some typical applications of DRAMMS include, but are not limited to,

- Cross-subject registration of the same organ (can be brain, breast, cardiac, etc);

- Mono- and Multi-modality registration (MRI, CT, histology);

- Longitudinal registration (pediatric brain growth, cancer development, mouse brain development, etc);

- Registration under missing correspondences (e.g., vascular lesions, tumors, histological cuts).


**Features**:

- Fully-automatic --- no need for segmentation or any prior knowledge or user-initialization/intervention;

- User-friendly --- two input images, two output (the registered image and the deformaiton field);
- Generality --- default parameters work reasonably well for most cases (raw images, preprocessed images, multi-site data, etc)
 

**Environment**: runs in UNIX/Mac, takes Nifti/ANALYZE/MetaImage format.
